Sample implementations of __A*__ search algorithm

Path finding has always been one interesting topic that has many usages
or can serve different purposes, a fun one could be maze solving, but 
regardless of the application, coding one it's also a challenging task 
that can help us to polish our skills and allow us to learn a few trick along the way.

This repository serves as my playground where I can share my experience 
as I try to learn how to implement __A*__ search.

I will try to explain the code as comments and some reasoning behind it, please bear with me. :grin:
